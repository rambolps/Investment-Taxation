<h3>What are tax deductions?</h3>
<p>Simply put, it is a cut to your tax liability which is done by reducing your taxable income. These deductions are more often than not expenses that taxpayers take on which can be subtracted from their gross income (reducing their taxable income which is the amount the CRA uses to determine how much tax is owed from the taxpayer).</p>

<h5>What is the difference between a tax credit and tax deduction?</h5>
<p>Unlike tax deductions which reduce your taxable income, tax credits directly reduce the tax amount you are required to pay the government. However, tax credits are less common amongst the typical taxpayer. <br>Examples of common types of tax credits include medical expenses, education expenses, and even for purchasing energy-efficient home products.</p>
